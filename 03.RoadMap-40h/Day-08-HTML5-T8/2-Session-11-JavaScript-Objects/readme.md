In real life, a car is an object.

A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:

All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.

All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.

In Javascript:

```js
//Object Car
const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
```

**Object Definition**

There are different ways to create new objects:

- Create a single object, using an object literal.

- Create a single object, with the keyword new.

- Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.

- Create an object using Object.create().
